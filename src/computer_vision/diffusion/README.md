## Diffusion models 

### Overview
This directory contains implementations of various diffusion models. The goal of these projects is to implement and test various diffusion models on simple toy problems. The projects are currently in development and are not yet at a stable state. This is more of a theoretical project to understand the Stable Diffusion algorithm and its applications.
